1. a. sigsetjmp saves the current location, CPU state and signal mask
   siglongjmp goes to the saved location, restoring the state and the signal mask
   b. sigsetjmp saves the current signal mask, and siglongjmp load the signal mask which the sigsetjmp save, so that's mean that if a signal is blocked after sigsetjmp, it will not be unblocked when siglongjmp is called to jump back to the saved location.

2. application that switches between threads often - such as ML application which uses multiprocessing and multithreading. because in user level threads, switching between threads is cheaper (run time wise).

3.  adventages:
		1. isolation - each tab in its own proccess.
	disadvantages:
		1. high overhead - all operations require a kernel trap.
		2. shared address space, memory, files - simple communication. 
		3. proccess creation is slower than thread creation. 
4. #TODO
5. Real time refers to the actual time that passes in the physical world, while virtual time refers to the time that is simulated or artificially created in a virtual environment or computer system.
example: farmville with a world simulation which has a time (sun mooves acording, seasons...)
